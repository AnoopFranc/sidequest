# Queue Priority in Sidequest

This document provides a detailed explanation of **queue priority** in Sidequest, its purpose, how it works, and best practices for configuring priorities effectively.

## What is queue priority?

**Queue priority** determines the relative importance of a queue compared to other queues when multiple queues have pending jobs. Queues with higher priority values are given preference by the scheduler when deciding which queueâ€™s jobs to process next.

Priority is configured per queue as a positive integer. There is no hard limit, but it is recommended to use a reasonable scale (e.g. 0â€“100) for clarity.

## How it works

When Sidequest has available workers and multiple queues have pending jobs, it compares the `priority` of each queue. Jobs from the highest-priority queue are selected first. Within a queue, jobs are processed in the order they were enqueued, respecting the queueâ€™s `concurrency` limit.

If two or more queues have the same priority, they are served in a round-robin fashion.

## Default behavior

If no priority is specified in a queueâ€™s configuration, it defaults to `0`.

Example:

```ts
queues: [
  { name: "default", concurrency: 2 }, // priority defaults to 0
  { name: "critical", concurrency: 5, priority: 100 },
  { name: "low", concurrency: 1, priority: 10 }
]
```

In this example, jobs in the `critical` queue will take precedence over `low` and `default`, as long as there is available concurrency.

## Best practices for priority

- ðŸ“Š **Use clear scales:** Choose a consistent scale for priorities (e.g. multiples of 10 or 100).
- ðŸ§© **Avoid excessive gaps:** Donâ€™t create extreme differences unless strictly necessary.
- ðŸ”„ **Balance with concurrency:** Priority only determines order, but `concurrency` limits still apply per queue.
- ðŸ§ª **Monitor impact:** Adjust priorities based on observed job throughput and latency.
